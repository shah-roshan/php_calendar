# php_calendar
This is a compact app that allows you to add several tasks in the calendar and see the full months calendar. This app does not persist the records to the database and is just a smaller version of a big calendar app. 
Note - In order to run the app, it is required to use either wamp or xampp server.
for wamp - put app folder into www
for xampp - put app folder into htdocs and run apache and tomcat services
